\chapter{Introduction}

\section{The Need for Speed}

In recent years, improvements in manufacturing, transportation and process industry
technologies bring about an increase in optimal operation speed in drive systems. In this
respect, recently developed high speed gear-less or direct-drive electrical drives have seen an
increase in interest based on the reduction in the total structural volume of the drive
system. Due to the significant development of cost-effective, fast switching and compact
variable frequency drives technology, wide speed range operations of different type AC motors
has become feasible. The speed definition of an induction motor can be seen in Eq.\ \ref{eq:speed}

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:speed}
  n = \frac{120 f}{p},
\end{equation}

In literature, there are several descriptions for the term "high-speed".  As a mechanical
engineer, peripheral speed over \SI{150}{\meter\per\second} is considered to be high speed
\cite{gieras2011performance}. From the motor manufacturer's point of view, a two-pole machine
which is supplied higher than 50 to \SI{60}{\hertz}, can be considered as a high-speed machine.
However, the most important point of view for the high-speed term is explained by development
at power electronics. Nowadays, up to few hundreds hertz frequencies can be produced by
variable frequency drives. However, voltage qualities of these are not satisfactory due to
limited switching frequency of high-power IGBT technology. Thus, high-speed levels might be
calculated for frequencies in the range of 100 to \SI{400}{\hertz} are considered to be
high-frequencies \cite{pyrhonen1991high}.  Owing to brush and commutator structure causing mechanical and
electrical problems, DC drives are not allowed to be used for high-speed applications. In
addition to the aforementioned statement, the structure is not appropriate for large
centrifugal forces.  Nevertheless, as high-speed drive applications, there are different type
of AC motor concepts proposed in literature
\cite{gieras2011performance, pyrhonen1991high, lahteenmaki2002design, saari1998thermal}:
Laminated/solid induction, permanent
magnet synchronous and switched reluctance synchronous motors.

It is due to remarkable improvements of power electronics, frequency inverters and AC
variable-speed drives, which allows a wider use of applications of solid-rotor induction motor
(SRIM). SRIM's are used in drive application ranging from a few kW's to 10 MW's. Fans,
compressors, pumps, gas turbines, sewing machines, space and aeronautics, auxiliary motors for
starting turbo-alternators, eddy current brakes, two-phase servomotors are a few examples of its
areas. \\

Below are the advantages of SRIM compared to CRIM:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
\item Structural and Mechanical integrity, Rigiditiy, Reliability and Strength of
  Material
\item High thermal properties
\item High speed in high power applications (high moment density)
\item Low noise and vibrations in high speed applications
\item Simple to protect against aggressive chemicals
\item Ease of Manufacturing
\item Low level of noise and vibrations (If the rotor has no slots)
\item Linearity of torque-speed characteristics throughout the entire speed range
\item The possibility of obtaining steady-state stability.
\end{itemize}

In 1950s, Solid-Rotor topologies for induction machines operating at high speeds
have gained a lot of interest. From its inception to 1970s, various scientists and engineers
have contributed to the development and the theory of solid rotor construction, where significant
interest was seen the 1990s for using solid rotor structure for high speed applications.

As the rotor does not contain any trace of copper \footnote{the rotor
  consists of a solid body of steel or similar ferromagnetic material}{windings}, the eddy currents
roam in the rotor without any conductive path restriction and cause the motor to
have different characteristics compared to a Cage Rotor Induction motor (CRIM), an industry standard
construction.
While eddy currents are the main principle of its operation, these currents also causes
the motor to have lower efficiency in slow speed aplications and this indirectly
decreases its power factor. But in high speed application where the speed is
around 30000 rpm the losses become far less and SRIM becomes the better choice for high speed
applications.

\subsection{Report Structure} %~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this report for Drive Technologies, the high-speed performance of the four
different types of rotors are investigated and compared using finite element analysis:
cage, smooth solid, axially slitted, coated is designed using a finite-element
analysis (FEA). All rotors are designed with similar geometries and construction parameters
to minimise the effect of unwanted effects.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]  
  // C++ program to find all string
  // which are greater than given length k 

  #include <bits/stdc++.h> 
  using namespace std;

  // function find string greater than
  // length k 
  void string_k(string s, int k) 
  {
    // create an empty string
    string w = "";
    // iterate the loop till every space
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
      if (s[i] != ' ')

      // append this sub string in
      // string w
      w = w + s[i];
      else {

        // if length of current sub
        // string w is greater than 
        // k then print
        if (w.size() > k)
        cout << w << " "; 
        w = "";
      }
    }
  }
\end{lstlisting}

The number of turns per stator slot is selected so as to obtain the
same stator current in rated operation. All four motors were analyzed using FEA
tools for 20 different speeds in order to obtain the combined torque-speed
characteristics. To illustrate visually the differences in the distributions of the
magnetic flux and the eddy current the results for 11300 rpm are presented and the
core loss, the total loss and the efficiency for the specific speed are compared for all
the motors. The designed four motors will be also compared for winding currents,
induced voltages, flux linkages, electromagnetic torque, copper losses, iron losses,
solid rotor losses and efficiency.
