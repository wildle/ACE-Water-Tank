This laboratory experiment investigates the control of a nonlinear hydraulic two-tank system.
The objective is to regulate the water level of the lower reservoir by controlling the pump
input. MATLAB and Simulink are used for modeling, controller design and simulation, as well as
for the implementation of the control algorithm on the laboratory hardware via a National
Instruments interface. In addition to feedback control, a flatness-based feed-forward approach
is considered to enable smooth reference trajectory tracking.
