\begin{itemize}
  \item Objective of the laboratory: modeling, linearization, and control of a nonlinear two-tank hydraulic system
  \item Overview of the considered system (pump, two reservoirs, sensors, actuator)
  \item Control goal: regulation of the water level in the second reservoir
  \item Brief description of the methodological workflow (modeling $\rightarrow$ linearization $\rightarrow$ control design $\rightarrow$ simulation)
  \item Structure of the report
\end{itemize}
