%This laboratory experiment investigates the control of a nonlinear 
%hydraulic two-tank system. The objective is to regulate the water 
%level of the lower reservoir by controlling the pump input. 

%MATLAB and Simulink are used for modeling, controller design and 
%simulation, as well as for the implementation of the control algorithm on the 
%laboratory hardware via a National Instruments interface. In addition 
%to feedback control, a flatness-based feed-forward approach is 
%considered to enable smooth reference trajectory tracking.

This laboratory investigates the control of a nonlinear hydraulic 
two-tank system. Water is pumped from a basin into the upper reservoir 
and flows into the lower reservoir due to gravity, where the
water level is measured and regulated by controlling the pump input.

The task focuses on modelling the nonlinear system dynamics, linearising the model around a
suitable operating point and designing a control strategy capable of regulating the water level and
enabling smooth transitions using trajectory planning and a flatness-based feed-forward approach.
MATLAB and Simulink are used for modelling, simulation and controller design, as well as for the
implementation of the control algorithm on the laboratory hardware via a National Instruments
interface.
